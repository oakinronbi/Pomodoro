# Pomodoro

Pomodoro is a simple and intuitive Pomodoro timer application built to enhance productivity and manage time effectively. This application follows the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.


## Usage

To use the Pomodoro timer, run the `main.py` file in your Python environment. The timer interface will appear with the following options:

- **Start**: Click the "Start" button to begin the Pomodoro timer. The timer will display the remaining time for each Pomodoro or break session.

- **Reset**: If needed, click the "Reset" button to stop the timer and reset it to the initial state.

- **Work Session**: The timer will start with a work session of 25 minutes. Focus on your tasks during this time.

- **Short Break**: After each work session, the timer will prompt a short break of 5 minutes. Use this time to relax and recharge.

- **Long Break**: After completing four work sessions, the timer will initiate a long break of 20 minutes. Take this opportunity for a longer break before continuing with your tasks.

- **Task Tracking**: As you complete each work session, the timer will display a checkmark (âœ”) to track your progress.
